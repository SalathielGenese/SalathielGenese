# Welcome @ Salathiel ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Salathiel, a veteran software engineer.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on modernizing the CI/CD pipelines of a mutinationale company, helping them migrate 30 years-ish software to cloud with battle-tested software engineering strategies (Lead DevOps).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about security hardening on Linux systems with SELinux, along with the intricacies of Kubernetes security (preparing for the Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on... Actually, I may have a few things on my plate & TODO list already. But shoot your shoot, if you think you've got something special.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with mentoring a few more people into the industry.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Linux, Container, Java, JavaScript, Rust, Go, Python, Shell, CI/CD, monitoring, system & software architectures, algorithms & data structures, distributed systems, data pipelines (Spark, Flink)...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter `@SalathielGenese`, LinkedIn `/in/SalathielGenese`
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Oh boy !!!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I lost appetite somewhere in 2018 but Cameroonian gari has my unconditional appreciation.
